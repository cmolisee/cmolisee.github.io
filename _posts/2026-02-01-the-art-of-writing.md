Writing is thinking made visible. When we write, we're forced to clarify our thoughts, to organize the chaos of our internal monologue into something coherent and shareable.

The best writing feels inevitable—as if the words could be arranged no other way. But achieving that sense of inevitability requires revision, editing, and a willingness to kill your darlings.

## Finding Your Voice

Your voice emerges through practice. Not through trying to sound a certain way, but through writing honestly and consistently. The quirks and rhythms that make your writing uniquely yours develop naturally over time.

Don't imitate. Don't force it. Just write, and let your voice find you.

## The Editing Process

First drafts are rarely good. That's okay—they're not supposed to be. The first draft is about getting ideas out of your head and onto the page. The real work happens in revision.

When editing:

1. Read it aloud
2. Cut ruthlessly
3. Clarify your thinking
4. Polish for rhythm

## On Consistency

Write regularly. Not because you have something profound to say every day, but because the practice itself is valuable. Muscles grow through repeated use; writing is no different.

Some days the words flow. Other days they don't. Show up anyway.
