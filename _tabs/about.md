Hi I'm Cody - a lead software engineer and manager who enjoys coffee, programming, and occasionally creating something that works.

# What I Do

By day, I do a lot of nerd things and try to be useful without going too overboard with my pessimistic humor. Through much effort I have ascended to a higher plane of existance and enlightmenent by discovering the secret to programming, managing and life - no I will not share it because it is a secret. However, I can say that communication is very important and you should always lead by example.

When I am not busy making a paycheck I enjoy:

* *Programming*: Because I apparently don't do it enough.
* *The Gym*: Lifting weights and hearing angry music is a great destressor.
* *Coaching*: Who doesn't love giving back and being a know-it-all.

# Why this Blog Exists

I was motivated by my workers and my short-term memory to create a digital memory bank - a place to document projects, share learnings, and occasionally force my points-of-view onto others. If this is shocking to you - so be it. You've entered my realm and a space of dry humor with technical speak. Sit back and read if you can.

# Fun Facts

* I often over engineer things.
* If I say something with enough confidence you will believe it.
* It's okay to say 'I don't know'.

_P.S. There is probably typo's and errors. No, I will not fix them right now._
